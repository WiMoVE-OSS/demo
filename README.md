# demo

This repository contains smaller projects used for the demonstrations at Berlin 6G Conference in July 2023 as well as the HPI Bachelorpodium.

## roamer and roamer-reconnect

These tools provide a web interface that can be used to control `wpa-cli` on a Linux laptop to show the roaming process between two APs.
This code is specific to the laptop we used for the demonstration. For this reason, you may need to modify the `wlan_iface` variable in the file `app/main.py`.
In addition, you may also want to modify the MAC addresses and names of the used APs.

To start the server, first install the requirements using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file.
Then run the following commands:

```bash
cd app
sudo uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> When setting up the demonstration, we noticed รก [Bug in FRR](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/13973) which results in connectivity issues after a roam.
> To still show movement between APs, we decided to modify the code located in `roamer` to first disconnect from the old and then reconnect to the new AP and placed that code in `roamer-reconnect`. It can be used the same way.

## portal

This is a captive portal that can be run on the gateway server to show users which virtual network they are in and what AP they are connected to.

To run the portal, you first need to install all dependencies using `npm i` and then build the typescript project using `npm build`.
You can then run the code by using

```bash
sudo ./run.sh
```

> Please note again that this code is very specific to the demo setup.
> The IPv4 address of the connected client is used to determine the VNI that it is connected to.
> In addition, it supports exactly three networks (VNI 1,2,3) which are represented by the colors red, green, and blue.
